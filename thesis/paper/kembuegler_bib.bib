    abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering.}

    abstract = {Clustering is an essential tool in data mining research and applications. It is the subject of active research in many fields of study, such as computer science, data science, statistics, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Several clustering techniques have been proposed and implemented, and most of them successfully find excellent quality or optimal clustering results in the domains mentioned earlier. However, there has been a gradual shift in the choice of clustering methods among domain experts and practitioners alike, which is precipitated by the fact that most traditional clustering algorithms still depend on the number of clusters provided a priori. These conventional clustering algorithms cannot effectively handle real-world data clustering analysis problems where the number of clusters in data objects cannot be easily identified. Also, they cannot effectively manage problems where the optimal number of clusters for a high-dimensional dataset cannot be easily determined. Therefore, there is a need for improved, flexible, and efficient clustering techniques. Recently, a variety of efficient clustering algorithms have been proposed in the literature, and these algorithms produced good results when evaluated on real-world clustering problems. This study presents an up-to-date systematic and comprehensive review of traditional and state-of-the-art clustering techniques for different domains. This survey considers clustering from a more practical perspective. It shows the outstanding role of clustering in various disciplines, such as education, marketing, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. It also discusses the application of clustering to different fields attracting intensive efforts among the scientific community, such as big data, artificial intelligence, and robotics. This survey paper will be beneficial for both practitioners and researchers. It will serve as a good reference point for researchers and practitioners to design improved and efficient state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.}
